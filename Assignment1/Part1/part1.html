        <h4>Subjects of study</h4>
        <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we welcome a wide range of research topics within the realm of science and technology. Based on your submitted ideas, we are particularly interested in:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H2O into wine and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H1203).</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures exceeding 300°C (860°F) when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10^3 increasing to 3 x 10^4).</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Please provide more details on each of these subjects, including expected research duration, required staff and resources, and any additional information you deem relevant.</p>
        
        <h4>Exotic dance moves</h4>
        <p>Regarding your inquiry about exotic tribal dances, here are my favorite dances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Polynesian chicken dance:</b> A dance dating back to 300BC, where villagers would mimic chickens to encourage their livestock.</li>
            <li><b>Icelandic brownian shuffle:</b> A pre-fire Icelandic dance involving rapid, imperceptible movements.</li>
            <li><b>Arctic robot dance:</b> Initially misinterpreted by English explorers as a robotic dance style, later discovered to be a result of extreme cold.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
